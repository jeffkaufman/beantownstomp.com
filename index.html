    Cambridge Masonic Hall<br>
    1950 Mass Ave Cambridge MA (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oTYk2jPj1j92">map</a>)

    <h2 id=schedule>Schedule</h2>

We're still sorting out details, but the weekend will include:

<ul>
<li>CONTRA DANCING
<li>Saturday morning family dance
<li>Sunday waltz session
<li>Open band opportunities
<li>Dance workshops
<li>Maybe something special for St. Patrick's Day?
<li>Time to see old friends and make new ones
<li>Many beautiful beans, including you!
</ul>

<h2 id=pricing>Pricing</h2>

We want people to be able to come regardless of means, so we're
offering a sliding scale of $45-$120.

<p>

We're predicting our break-even figure will be about $65/person, and
the more you're able to contribute the more we're able to pay our
musicians and let others attend below cost.

<p>

Any money that the weekend makes above breaking even will be split
between BIDA, LCFD, and our musicians and callers.

<p>

<details>
<summary>Unfamiliar with sliding scales?</summary>

Money is a social construct, right? But also, its effects are very
real: we need it to buy food, pay rent, get to dance weekends, pay
talented musicians for creating magic that brings us together,
etc. etc. So a sliding scale is a way of accommodating different
incomes and asking you, the dancers, to take account of what kind of
financial situation you're experiencing, and pay accordingly. Here are
some examples:

<ul>
  <li><p>$65 Break-even point: this is the amount we estimate will cover
  our costs for performers, venue, sound, food, everything. If
  everyone paid this, we'd come out ok. But, read on...

  <li><p>$45 Minimum: if you can only afford this much, that's ok! We'd
  love for you to be able to come and dance. If you can't pay at least
  $40, we recommend volunteering (above).

  <li><p>$80-$100: this is an opportunity to help cover the difference
  for someone who can't pay a full ticket. Maybe you're in a good job
  or comfortable situation, or maybe you're wanting to give back
  directly to your community. It's been a weird, hard couple of years
  for many. Paying $80 will cover the difference of one person
  attending at the minimum. Paying $100 will cover two.

  <li><p>Giving even more: Paying $100-$120 will allow us to give extra
  to our performers and help BIDA continue to run affordable events in
  the future!
</details>

<h2 id=gender>Gender and Roles</h2>

All calling will be gender-free, with Larks/Robins terms.  The
bathrooms will also not be gendered.  This event is not gender or role
balanced, and anyone is welcome to dance either or both roles.

<h2 id=housing>Housing</h2>

Housing isn't included, but we expect to set something up to try and help
out-of-town dancers match with local dancers who are willing to host.

<h2 id=transportation>Transportation</h2>
<h3>Public Transit</h3>

Public transit is a great way to get to and from the hall, which is at
the Porter Square stop on the Red Line Subway, the Fitchburg Line
Commuter Rail, and the 77, 83, 87, and 96 buses.  For detailed
directions and schedules Google Maps works well: <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/3usvVVZjUZ22">Cambridge Masonic Hall</a>.

<h3 id=parking>Driving</h3>

<dl style="margin-left:1em">
<dt>Friday and Saturday:</dt>
<dd><p>The parking lot at the Kennedy School (<a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/KtD2bC3oFQ92">map</a>) a short walk away is

<dd><p>Parking meters on Mass Ave or at metered municipal lots <a

</dl>

<p>

Please don't park in the big shopping center lot across the street from
the hall, because they tow.

<h2 id=accessibility>Accessibility</h2>

See BIDA's general <a
href="https://www.bidadance.org/accessibility">accessibility
information</a>; note that the venue is not wheelchair accessible.
Unlike BIDA's regular evening dances, this event is low-fragrance.

<h2 id=covid>Covid</h2>

Because the COVID situation is ever-changing, we will publish our
final COVID policy by February 1st.

<p>

At this time, our policy is to require a rapid test on Friday before
you arrive. Confirmation of your testing with a timestamp will be part
of checking in for the weekend.  Masks will not be required but are
certainly welcome. In line with BIDA's policy, vaccination is also not
required. Don't come if you're at all sick, with anything. Let's have
a healthy dance weekend!

<h2 id=refunds>Refund Policy</h2>

We'll refund you if we can fill your place, but we may keep an admin
and payment processing fee.  If you are symptomatic or testing
positive we'll refund you even if we can't fill your place&mdash;don't
come if you're sick!

<h2 id=kids>Childcare</h2>

Childcare will be available Saturday daytime after the family dance
and all day Sunday

<h2 id=volunteering>Volunteering</h2>

We will have a limited number of SuperVolunteer roles who get free
admission to the weekend in exchange for a larger time commitment. You
can sign up for most smaller volunteer roles at check in. More details
in the registration form.

<h2 id=open-band>Open Band</h2>

We will have an open band during our Saturday morning family dance. It
will be very relaxed - no microphones, not much leading, just playing
tunes acoustically.

<h2 id=sponsors>Sponsors</h2>

This weekend is a joint project of the <a
href="https://lcfd.org/jp">JP Gender Free Contra Dance</a> and <a
href="https://www.bidadance.org">Boston Intergenerational Dance Advocates</a>.
