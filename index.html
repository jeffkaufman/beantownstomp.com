<h2 id=pricing>Pricing</h2>

We want people to be able to come regardless of means, so we're
offering a sliding scale of $45-$120.

<p>

We're predicting our break-even figure will be about $65/person, and
the more you're able to contribute the more we're able to pay our
musicians and let others attend below cost.

<p>

Any money that the weekend makes above breaking even will be split
between BIDA and our musicians and callers.

<p>

<details>
<summary>Unfamiliar with sliding scales?</summary>

Money is a social construct, right? But also, its effects are very
real: we need it to buy food, pay rent, get to dance weekends, pay
talented musicians for creating magic that brings us together,
etc. etc. So a sliding scale is a way of accommodating different
incomes and asking you, the dancers, to take account of what kind of
financial situation you're experiencing, and pay accordingly. Here are
some examples:

<ul>
  <li><p>$65 Break-even point: this is the amount we estimate will cover
  our costs for performers, venue, sound, food, everything. If
  everyone paid this, we'd come out ok. But, read on...

  <li><p>$45 Minimum: if you can only afford this much, that's ok! We'd
  love for you to be able to come and dance. If you can't pay at least
  $45, we recommend <a href="#volunteering">volunteering</a>.

  <li><p>$80-$100: this is an opportunity to help cover the difference
  for someone who can't pay a full ticket. Maybe you're in a good job
  or comfortable situation, or maybe you're wanting to give back
  directly to your community. It's been a weird, hard couple of years
  for many. Paying $80 will cover the difference of one person
  attending at the minimum. Paying $100 will cover two.

  <li><p>Giving even more: Paying $100-$120 will allow us to give extra
  to our performers and help BIDA continue to run affordable events in
  the future!
</details>

<h2 id=gender>Gender and Roles</h2>

All calling will be gender-free, with Larks/Robins terms.  The
bathrooms will also not be gendered.  This event is not gender or role
balanced, and anyone is welcome to dance either or both roles.

<h2 id=housing>Housing</h2>

Housing isn't included, but we expect to set something up to try and help
out-of-town dancers match with local dancers who are willing to host.

<h2 id=transportation>Transportation</h2>
<h3>Public Transit</h3>

Public transit is a great way to get to and from the hall, which is at
the Porter Square stop on the Red Line Subway, the Fitchburg Line
Commuter Rail, and the 77, 83, 87, and 96 buses.  For detailed
directions and schedules Google Maps works well: <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/3usvVVZjUZ22">Cambridge Masonic Hall</a>.

<h3 id=parking>Driving</h3>

<p>

Please don't park in the big shopping center lot across the street from
the hall, because they tow.

<h2 id=accessibility>Accessibility</h2>

See BIDA's general <a
href="https://www.bidadance.org/accessibility">accessibility
information</a>; note that the venue is not wheelchair accessible.
Unlike BIDA's regular evening dances, this event is low-fragrance.

<h2 id=covid>Covid</h2>

We'll require proof of a negative covid rapid test taken on
Friday. You'll show your test or a photo of it when you check
in. Masks will not be required, but are certainly welcome. In line
with <a href="https://www.bidadance.org/accessibility">BIDA's
policy</a>, vaccination is also not required. Please don't attend if
you're at all sick, with anything! We'll fully refund any
cancellations due to illness. Let's have a healthy dance weekend!

<h2 id=refunds>Refund Policy</h2>

We'll refund you for any reason, if we can fill your place. Refunds
will not include Venmo's fee (usually under $2).

<p>

If you become symptomatic (of anything!) or test positive for COVID,
we will refund you fully&mdash;Don't come if you're sick!

<h2 id=kids>Childcare</h2>

Childcare will be available Saturday daytime after the family dance
(with the exception of lunch) and all day Sunday.  On the schedule
these times are marked with <img alt="childcare available"
title="childcare available" src="child-icon.png"
srcset="child-icon-2x.png 2x">

<h2 id=volunteering>Volunteering</h2>

We will have a limited number of SuperVolunteer roles who get free
admission to the weekend in exchange for a larger time commitment. You
can sign up for most smaller volunteer roles at check in. More details
in the registration form.

<h2 id=saturday-morning>Saturday Morning</h2>

We'll start Saturday off with a family dance to an open band.  While
this is included in a weekend registration it's also open to all: you
can pay at the door with cash or Venmo ($3 for kids, and $5-$20 for
everyone else).  As always, the open band is free for musicians,
though we're happy to take donations!  People attending the family
dance are also invited to stay until noon to dance the first set of
contras.

<p>
<a name=open-band></a>

If you would like to play in the open band, just bring your
instrument.  It will be very relaxed - no microphones, no arranging,
just playing tunes acoustically.  The tune list for this year is:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jefftk.com/contras/tunes/Trad-LaBastringue-FW---D-reel.jpg">La Bastringue</a> (D)
<li><a href="https://www.jefftk.com/contras/tunes/Trad-RoadToBoston-FW--D-reel.jpg">Road to Boston</a> (D)

<li>Waltz: <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/contras/tunes/LukeThomasson-MidnightOnTheWater--D-waltz.png">Midnight on the water</a> (D)
