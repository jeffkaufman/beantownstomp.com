<p>

<h2 id=family-dance>Family Dance</h2>

The family dance will be on Saturday morning, and will be open to
everyone, not just families, but will have dances targeted at very
young dancers.

<p>

If you want to come to <i>only</i> the family dance, you don't have to
register for the weekend.  Just show up and pay cash at the door:
$3-$10.  All other sessions require registration.

<h2 id=open-band>Open Band</h2>

We will have an open band during our Saturday morning family dance. It
will be very relaxed - no microphones, not much leading, just playing
tunes acoustically.

<h2 id=pricing>Pricing</h2>

We want people to be able to come regardless of means, so we're
offering a sliding scale of $40-$120.

<p>

We're predicting our break-even figure will be about $60/person, and
the more you're able to contribute the more we're able to pay our
musicians and let others attend below cost.

<p>

Any money that the weekend makes above breaking even will be split
between BIDA, LCFD, and our musicians and callers.

<p>

<details>
<summary>Unfamiliar with sliding scales?</summary>

Money is a social construct, right? But also, its effects are very
real: we need it to buy food, pay rent, get to dance weekends, pay
talented musicians for creating magic that brings us together,
etc. etc. So a sliding scale is a way of accommodating different
incomes and asking you, the dancers, to take account of what kind of
financial situation you're experiencing, and pay accordingly. Here are
some examples:

<ul>
  <li><p>$60 Break-even point: this is the amount we estimate will cover
  our costs for performers, venue, sound, food, everything. If
  everyone paid this, we'd come out ok. But, read on...

  <li><p>$40 Minimum: if you can only afford this much, that's ok! We'd
  love for you to be able to come and dance. If you can't pay at least
  $40, we recommend volunteering (above).

  <li><p>$80-$100: this is an opportunity to help cover the difference
  for someone who can't pay a full ticket. Maybe you're in a good job
  or comfortable situation, or maybe you're wanting to give back
  directly to your community. It's been a weird, hard couple of years
  for many. Paying $80 will cover the difference of one person
  attending at the minimum. Paying $100 will cover two.

  <li><p>Giving even more: Paying $100-$120 will allow us to give extra
  to our performers and help BIDA continue to run affordable events in
  the future!
</details>


<h2 id=gender>Gender and Roles</h2>

All calling will be gender-free, with Larks/Robins terms.  The
bathrooms will also not be gendered.  This event is not gender or role
balanced, and anyone is welcome to dance either or both roles.

<h2 id=food>Food</h2>
<h3>Meals</h3>

You can bring food, buy food at the <a
href="https://local.starmarket.com/ma/cambridge/49-white-st.html">supermarket
across the street</a>, or eat at one of the <a
href="/restaurant-guide">many nearby restaurants</a>.  There is
refrigerator and freezer space available at the hall, as well as a
microwave.  We're planning on breaks for lunch and dinner on Saturday.

<h3>Snacks</h3>

There will be plenty of snacks at the hall, with vegetarian, vegan,
and gluten-free options.  There will be light snacks out most of the
time, and more substantial snacks Sunday around lunchtime.  If you
have dietary restrictions there's a space for that on the <a
href="/registration">registration form</a>.

<h2 id=housing>Housing</h2>

Housing isn't included, but we will try to match out-of-town dancers
with local dancers who are willing to host.  There's a bit asking
about this on <a href="/registration">registration</a>.  We can't
guarantee a match, but we will do our best.

<h2 id=transportation>Transportation</h2>
<h3>Public Transit</h3>

Public transit is a great way to get to and from the hall, which is at
the Porter Square stop on the Red Line Subway, the Fitchburg Line
Commuter Rail, and the 77, 83, 87, and 96 buses.  For detailed
directions and schedules Google Maps works well: <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/3usvVVZjUZ22">Cambridge Masonic Hall</a>.

general <a href="https://www.bidadance.org/accessibility">accessibility

<ul>

Beantown Stomp will continue to follow BIDA's covid policy and is
subject to change.

There will be childcare for the daytime parts of the weekend, and a
family dance.
