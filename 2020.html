<div class=warning>

Due to the coronavirus, Beantown Stomp 2020 is cancelled.  We know
many people have travel booked for this weekend, and we've all been
looking forward to it for months.  But we also know that reducing
person-to-person transmission is crucial for slowing the spread of
this disease, and social dancing is the opposite of social distancing.

<p>

If you would like your money back we're happy to return it in full.
As dances around the country are cancelling however, we're looking
towards a rough Spring for people who make their living playing and
calling for contra dances.  If your financial circumstances allow,
consider waiving your refund so we have funds to pay our performers.
Please <a href="/refund">fill out this form</a> to let us know how
we should handle your payment.  We'll be emailing everyone as soon as
we can.

<p>

Beantown Stomp 2021 will be March 12th-14th.

<p>

Sessions marked <img alt="childcare available" title="childcare
available" src="child-icon.png" srcset="child-icon-2x.png 2x"> have
free childcare available.  Please include on your registration (or
write jeff@bidadance.org) if you'd like to use it.

<h2 id=family-dance>Family Dance</h2>

The family dance on Sunday morning is open to everyone, not just
families, but will have dances targeted at very young dancers.

<p>

While the rest of the weekend requires advance registration, if you
want to come <i>just</i> for the family dance you can pay at the door.
If you do, it's BIDA's usual $5-$15 for adults and $3 for kids.

<h2 id=open-band>Open Band</h2>

There will be two open band slots, both open to anyone who would like
to play.  The slots will feel pretty different:

<ul>

<li><p>The family dance will be very relaxed.  No microphones, not
much leading, just playing tunes acoustically.</li>

<li><p>The regular dance will be more intense.  We'll be playing to a
full hall with lots of leading / orchestration.  If you have a pickup
or clip-on mic, bring it along!</li> </ul>

<p>

Sets for the evening open band: TBD

<h2 id=hours>Hours</h2>

The hall will be open:

<ul>
<li>Friday: 5pm-11:30pm
<li>Saturday: 9am-11:30pm
<li>Sunday: 9am-5pm
</ul>

In 2020 it will probably be similar.

<h2 id=registration>Pricing and Registration</h2>

Last year we asked for $50-$150/person, and <a
href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/beantown-stomp-retrospective">did a
little better than break-even</a>.  We're planning to admit more
dancers this year, so we think we're able to move the price a bit
lower, to a sliding scale of $30-$130. If you're able to pay toward
the higher end, that's what makes it possible for us to offer
admission to others below cost.  We also have volunteer spots
available.

<p>

We will admit the first 150 dancers first-come-first-served.  If these
150 slots all are claimed within the first week (before Tuesday
November 19th) we'll pause registration and announce a lottery for the
remaining slots.

<p>

To keep things simple, tickets are full-weekend, but if we sell out we
may be able to make some additional part-weekend slots available for
non-peak times.

<p>

Everyone needs to register and pay in advance.  Kids below dancing age
are free; just mention them on your registration.

<p>

<a id=register-button href="/registration">Register</a>

<h2 id=gender>Gender and Roles</h2>

All calling will be gender-free, with Larks/Robins terms.  The
bathrooms will also not be gendered.  This event is not gender or role
balanced, and anyone is welcome to dance either or both roles.

<h2 id=food>Food</h2>
<h3>Meals</h3>

You can bring food, buy food at the <a
href="https://local.starmarket.com/ma/cambridge/49-white-st.html">supermarket
across the street</a>, or eat at one of the <a
href="/restaurant-guide">many nearby restaurants</a>.  There is
refrigerator and freezer space available at the hall, as well as a
microwave.  We're planning on breaks for lunch and dinner on Saturday.

<h3>Snacks</h3>

There will be plenty of snacks at the hall, with vegetarian, vegan,
and gluten-free options.  There will be light snacks out most of the
time, and more substantial snacks Sunday around lunchtime.  If you
have dietary restrictions there's a space for that on the <a
href="/registration">registration form</a>.

<h2 id=housing>Housing</h2>

Housing isn't included, but we will try to match out-of-town dancers
with local dancers who are willing to host.  There's a bit asking
about this on <a href="/registration">registration</a>.  We're
planning to start working on this around 2/11, and if you register
after that we may not be able to connect you with anyone.

<h2 id=transportation>Transportation</h2>
<h3>Public Transit</h3>

Public transit is a great way to get to and from the hall, which is at
the Porter Square stop on the Red Line Subway, the Fitchburg Line
Commuter Rail, and the 77, 83, 87, and 96 buses.  For detailed
directions and schedules Google Maps works well: <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/3usvVVZjUZ22">Cambridge Masonic Hall</a>.
